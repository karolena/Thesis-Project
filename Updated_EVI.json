Biblioburro is being operated by Luis Soriano, a primary school teacher, during his spare time. Witnessing kids, wearing a genuine smile each time he visits their villages in rural Colombia, would surely warm anybody’s heart. Using two donkeys, Alfa and Beto, to carry loads of books, Soriano spends four hours on each trip just to reach those remote places."

These communities are too small to each have their own library, so, when the inhabitants of the Hordaland County were offered a book boat in 1959, Epos was born. Nowadays, the boat travels to 250 small hamlets across Norway, bringing books, culture and entertainment to the people."

          "Pressler manages to talk without stopping, but without losing her young audience. Their eyes follow her as she springs around the room discussing history and geography, pulling down a world map here and pointing to an architectural poster there. Pulling out packages of pasta, she wows the kids with the variety of ingredients used to make different kinds of it, including soy, buckwheat, rice, corn and rye. Soon the class is shrieking with delight as they run dough through pasta machines and measure it for the longest-noodle contest.",
          "Pressler is a role model with a diverse background. “І went to school in architecture and interior design. І’d always loved science, so then I went to graduate school in textile chemistry. Then I said, “І’m going to chef school now, as a hobby.” And I found that’s where my heart was. I worked as a pastry chef for a number of years and really loved that.” She missed interacting with more people, however.",
          "Pressler says she dreams of expanding the program to reach more students at other schools or taking her program to television. Her recipe for success is to integrate learning with life, instill enthusiasm for learning in the children, and inspire them to achieve their heart’s desire.",

During its 900-year history, Leeds Castle has been the private property of six of England’s medieval Queens and a palace used by Henry VIII. Lady Baillie, the last private owner, inherited the place in the early 1900s. In the 1930s Lady Baillie entertained high society from London coming to the castle for weekends. Today the interior offers visitors a glimpse of its rich past with a fine collection of art, porcelain and furniture."

                "World’s Most Expensive Book Goes Up for Sale\nA rare copy of John James Audubon’s Birds of America, (17) , has been announced to go on sale at Sotheby’s. Only 119 complete copies of the 19th-century book are known to exist, and 108 are owned by museums and libraries. A separate edition of the wildlife book was sold for a record-breaking price of £5.7million a decade ago. The copy going under the hammer in December comes from the collection of Lord Hesketh. It contains 1,000 life-sized illustrations of almost 500 breeds. It took wildlife artist John James Audubon 12 years (18) . He did so by travelling across America, shooting the birds. He would then hang them on bits of wire to paint them. The artist then went to Britain to print the volumes and targeted the rich to buy copies. Lord Hesketh’s collection also includes a rare copy of Shakespeare’s First Folio, which Sotheby’s said is (19) . Of the 750 that were probably printed, only 219 are known to exist today. The copy, (20) , is offered for sale. It has a valuation of up to £1.5 million, and only has three pages missing. It is one of only three textually complete copies to exist in private hands in a comparably early binding.
